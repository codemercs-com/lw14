# LED-Warrior14 example codes
This repository includes some example projects for Arduino, Linux (Raspberry PI & Co.) and Windows (with IO-Warrior as interface).  

## Recommended hardware (Module)
If you wan to use an IO-Warrior14 module on you I2C-Host, you must use the **LED-Warrior14-01** module to protect your SOC board against the IEC62386 bus.  

## I2C bus and connection
You can use several LED-Warrior14 on the same I2C bus by using different I2C device addresses on each LED-Warrior14. You can change this address by using an I2C command.
